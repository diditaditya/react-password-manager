# REACT PASSWORD MANAGER

A simple web app which could help you to create a list of your passwords for websites. You could add new passwords, delete, edit, and filter the saved passwords. The app has password validation as well. This simple app is made using React, redux, json-server, and material-design-lite. Leave the old extremely-bad habit of using same password for so many websites just because you realize you cannot remember them all!

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local storage, and go to the folder,
```sh
$ cd password-manager
```
install dependencies,
```sh
$ npm install
```
start the json-server using port 4000,
```sh
$ json-server --watch src/database/db.json --port 4000
```
in a new terminal tab start the react by default using port 3000,
```sh
$ npm start
```

## Note

This is still in development stage, however it is useable.
